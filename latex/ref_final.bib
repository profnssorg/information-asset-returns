 abstract = {Previously, academics have used the supply of information that arrives to market (e.g., macroeconomic announcements, earnings reports, or news releases) to study how information affects asset prices and anomalies, and for tests of market efficiency. In this paper, we instead use measures of institutional and retail demand for information. We show that institutional demand for information is associated with increased trading volume and significant price movements. Average returns and betas are higher on days with higher institutional demand for information. The magnitude of these effects is much larger than those associated with the supply of news. However, the impact of demand for information from retail investors, while statistically significant, is quite small in magnitude. We also show that higher institutional demand alleviates mispricing in the market. In particular, higher information processing by institutional investors dampens momentum and enhances long-term reversals. As such, when demand for information increases, the market becomes more efficient.},

abstract = {Abstract This paper adopts a vector autoregression-generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity approach to model the dynamic linkages between both mean and variance of macro news and commodity returns (Gold, Corn, Wheat, Soybeans, Silver, Platinum, Palladium, Copper, Aluminium and Crude Oil) over the period 01/01/2001–26/09/2014. The chosen specification also controls for the effect of the exchange rate. The results can be summarized as follows. Mean spillovers running from news to commodity returns are positive with the exception of Gold and Silver. Volatility spillovers are bigger in size and affect most commodity returns. Both first-moment and second-moment linkages are stronger in the post-September 2008 period. Overall, our findings confirm that commodities, despite not being financial assets, are sensitive to macro news (especially their volatility) and also suggest that the global financial crisis has strengthened such linkages.

Moreover, we demonstrate that the sign of stock returns is predictable contrary to the levels, where predictability has proven elusive in the US context. Finally, we provide novel evidence on the economic value of sign predictability and show that investors can form profitable investment strategies using the SVI."

In this study we employ a proxy for information demand which is derived from weekly internet search volume. The latest is drawn from Google Trends database, for 25 of the largest stocks traded on CAC40 index, between April 2007 and March 2014. We use news headlines as a proxy for information supply. Our empirical findings suggest: First public information has an impact on stock returns but its impact on the volatility is much more important. Second, the influence of specific information demand to the company persists even by adding market information demand and firm/market information supply. Finally, by applying MCA to results found, it could be concluded that the impact of public information on stock return and volatility is conditioned by two elements: The company and market news disclosure, and the second element relates to the characteristics of the market participants, more precisely their news interpretations and their risk aversion."

This paper constructs measures of political uncertainty and formally explores their relationship with market uncertainty, as measured by implied volatility. The empirical evidence suggests that increasing (decreasing) levels of uncertainty around the election result induce higher (lower) levels of market uncertainty. In a case of the market preferring the devil it knows, an increasing (decreasing) likelihood of the incumbent party, whose economic policies are well-known, winning the election, reduces market uncertainty. The results remain significant even after controlling for a number of macroeconomic variables, and when an alternative GARCH framework is considered."

The paper uses an extended monetary policy rule that allows analysis of the impact of uncertainty about the conditions in financial markets on the interest rate setting behavior that describes the South African Reserve Bank’s monetary policy decisions. The results indicate that the effect of uncertainty on the interest rates has led to a more cautious monetary policy stance by the monetary authorities consistent with a large body of literature that recognizes that an excessively activist policy can increase economic instability. The results further show that uncertainty about the state of the economy clusters around the financial crisis periods in 2003 and from 2007 to 2009. The uncertainty about inflation was important to the interest rate setting behavior in 2003 and between 2007 and 2008, while the uncertainty about the conditions in financial markets was important to the interest rate setting behavior between 2008 and 2009.

Risk, return, and equilibrium: empirical tests.

This result is consistent across several alternative specifications of the AQ metric. We also distinguish between accruals quality driven by economic fundamentals (innate AQ) versus management choices (discretionary AQ). Both components have significant cost of capital effects, but innate AQ effects are significantly larger than discretionary AQ effects."

We find that the unit root null hypothesis is rejected in 40% of the stocks, and only in four out of the nine sectors the null is rejected for over 50% of stocks. We conclude with an economic significance analysis, showing that mostly stocks with mean reverting prices tend to outperform stocks with non-stationary prices."

  abstract={The Efficient Markets Hypothesis (EMH) has been one of the most influential ideas in the past years and highlights that assets prices incorporate all information rationally and instantaneously. The last financial crisis has led to criticism of this hypothesis. Many practical observations concerning the reaction of investors, but also the mechanisms for the information encompassing in the price of stocks, come to highlight the aspects of 'market inefficiency'. Despite its simplicity, the EMH is surprisingly difficult to test and considerable care has to be exercised in empirical tests. It has attracted a considerable number of studies in empirical finance, particularly in determining the market efficiency of an emerging financial market. Empirical tests have given mixed results about efficiency in these markets. The major challenges to EMH are mainly in the following forms: empirical tests for EMH show no evidence in favour of EMH, the existence of the limitations of the statistical and mathematical models for EMH, the evidence of the excess volatility mean reversion predictability, the existence of bubbles, and non-linear complex dynamics and chaos in the stock market. Efficiency tests in emergent markets are rarely definitive in reaching a conclusion about the issue, because, for a test to be reliable, it should take into consideration the institutional features of these markets. To test the hypothesis of informational efficiency of an emergent market, one should take into account some peculiarities of these markets, like: nonlinearity of asset prices, thin trading, the financial liberalization impact on the performance of emerging markets. The paper proposes a critical analysis regarding the testing methods of the informational efficiency theory of the capital market and also proposes new perspectives that are meant to relax the strong EMH assumptions in emerging markets.},

We show that differences in the composition of information between public and private information affect the cost of capital, with investors demanding a higher return to hold stocks with greater private information. This higher return arises because informed investors are better able to shift their portfolio to incorporate new information, and uninformed investors are thus disadvantaged. In equilibrium, the quantity and quality of information affect asset prices. We show firms can influence their cost of capital by choosing features like accounting treatments, analyst coverage, and market microstructure.}

Using accruals quality to proxy for information risk, Francis et al. (2005) provide empirical support for this argument using a sample of US firms. This paper re-examines the interplay of accruals quality, information risk and cost of capital in Australia, where a number of important institutional and regulatory differences are hypothesized to affect the relation between accruals quality and cost of capital. The results suggest that, while accruals quality impacts on the cost of capital for Australian firms, some salient differences exist. In contrast to findings for US firms, the costs of debt and equity for Australian firms are largely influenced by accruals quality arising from economic fundamentals (i.e., innate accrual quality) but not discretionary reporting choices (i.e., discretionary accrual quality). This finding is consistent with our predictions based on the Australian institutional and regulatory environment. In addition, using both the asset pricing tests in Francis et al. (2005) and Core et al. (2008), we provide evidence consistent with accruals quality being a priced risk factor.}

Using two-stage cross-sectional regression tests, we find that the AQ risk factor is significantly priced, after controlling for low-priced stocks. This result is robust in tests using individual stocks, various portfolio formations, and different beta estimations. Furthermore, we show that AQ and its pricing effect systematically very with business cycles and macroeconomic variables. In particular, this pricing effect is prominent in total AQ and innate AQ but not in discretionary AQ. The risk premium associated with AQ exists only in economic expansion but not in recession periods. Poorer AQ firms are more vulnerable to macroeconomic shocks. The risk premium and the dispersion of AQ are also related to future economic activity. Overall, our results suggest that AQ contributes to the cost of equity capital and that its pricing effect is associated with fundamental risk.},

We also investigate whether AQ is a priced risk factor. Using a two stage cross-sectional regression, we show that an AQ measure explains the cross-section of stock returns. AQ also explains the time-series variation in returns for two sets of portfolios: 16 size-BM portfolios, and 20 industry portfolios. Consistent with some recent US evidence, however, we find no evidence that AQ is a priced risk factor for UK stocks.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT This paper studies the relation between changes in financial investment opportunities and changes in the macroeconomy. States variables such as the lagged production growth rate, the default premium, the term premium, the short-term interest rate and the market dividend-price ratio are shown to be indicators of recent and future economic growth. Further, the market excess return is negatively correlated with recent economic growth and positively correlated with expected future economic growth. These results offer straightforward interpretations of recent evidence on the forecasts of the market excess return by state variable via their forecasts on the macroeconomy.}

After October 6, 1979, a significant positive correlation is found between announced money supply innovations and changes in the yields on government securities of all maturities. This finding calls into question the view that rates rise in response to an unexpected increase in the money supply because market participants interpret the jump as a signal that the Federal Reserve Board will tighten in the future. While expected future monetary restriction may drive up short rates, it should not have the same effect on long rates.},

The theoretical basis of the tests is the "two-parameter" portfolio model and models of market equilibrium derived from the two-parameter portfolio model. We cannot reject the hypothesis of these models that the pricing of common stocks reflects the attempts of risk-averse investors to hold portfolios that are "efficient" in terms of expected value and dispersion of return. Moreover, the observed "fair game" properties of the coefficients and residuals of the risk-return regressions are consistent with an "efficient capital market"--that is, a market where prices of securities},

 abstract = {Traditional econometric models assume a constant one-period forecast variance. To generalize this implausible assumption, a new class of stochastic processes called autoregressive conditional heteroscedastic (ARCH) processes are introduced in this paper. These are mean zero, serially uncorrelated processes with nonconstant variances conditional on the past, but constant unconditional variances. For such processes, the recent past gives information about the one-period forecast variance. A regression model is then introduced with disturbances following an ARCH process. Maximum likelihood estimators are described and a simple scoring iteration formulated. Ordinary least squares maintains its optimality properties in this set-up, but maximum likelihood is more efficient. The relative efficiency is calculated and can be infinite. To test whether the disturbances follow an ARCH process, the Lagrange multiplier procedure is employed. The test is based simply on the autocorrelation of the squared OLS residuals. This model is used to estimate the means and variances of inflation in the U.K. The ARCH effect is found to be significant and the estimated variances increase substantially during the chaotic seventies.},

In this context, I study the equilibrium dynamics of limit order markets. Continuous idiosyncratic liquidity shocks result in trades on both sides of the order book. News therefore arrives at random times. Following news, order flows become unbalanced and market depth is consumed, leading to positive covariance between price variability, trading volume, and order book unbalances. Holding the unconditional price variability constant, news frequency has a negative effect on both market depth and the variability-volume covariance.}

The asymptotic distribution of the statistic is derived under the null and under the alternative that the series is difference-stationary. Finite sample size and power are considered in a Monte Carlo experiment. The test is applied to the Nelson-Plosser data, and for many of these series the hypothesis of trend stationarity cannot be rejected."

 abstract = {Many statistical models, and in particular autoregressive-moving average time series models, can be regarded as means of transforming the data to white noise, that is, to an uncorrelated sequence of errors. If the parameters are known exactly, this random sequence can be computed directly from the observations; when this calculation is made with estimates substituted for the true parameter values, the resulting sequence is referred to as the "residuals," which can be regarded as estimates of the errors. If the appropriate model has been chosen, there will be zero autocorrelation in the errors. In checking adequacy of fit it is therefore logical to study the sample autocorrelation function of the residuals. For large samples the residuals from a correctly fitted model resemble very closely the true errors of the process; however, care is needed in interpreting the serial correlations of the residuals. It is shown here that the residual autocorrelations are to a close approximation representable as a singular linear transformation of the autocorrelations of the errors so that they possess a singular normal distribution. Failing to allow for this results in a tendency to overlook evidence of lack of fit. Tests of fit and diagnostic checks are devised which take these facts into account.},

We find that when the economy is strong the stock market responds negatively to news about higher real economic activity. This negative relation is caused by the larger increase in discount rates relative to expected cash flows.

Several types of evidence – including human readings of 12,000 newspaper articles – indicate that our index proxies for movements in policy-related economic uncertainty. Our US index spikes near tight presidential elections, Gulf Wars I and II, the 9/11 attacks, the failure of Lehman Brothers, the 2011 debt-ceiling dispute and other major battles over fiscal policy. Using firm-level data, we find that policy uncertainty raises stock price volatility and reduces investment and employment in policy-sensitive sectors like defense, healthcare, and infrastructure construction. At the macro level, policy uncertainty innovations foreshadow declines in investment, output, and employment in the United States and, in a panel VAR setting, for 12 major economies. Extending our US index back to 1900, EPU rose dramatically in the 1930s (from late 1931) and has drifted upwards since the 1960s.},
