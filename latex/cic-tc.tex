\begin{abstract}
    We investigate whether political news affect the exchange coupon in Brazil, in a period ranging from November 24, 2016, until April 16, 2019. Our sample of news is collected via web scrapping, which we apply on a Brazilian news portal. We use two measures for the exchange coupon, and we apply a GARCH model to estimate conditional volatility, which we filter with both a parametric and a non parametric approach. The results from the parametric analysis indicate that the exchange coupon was affected by the corruption scandal of President Temer (May, 2017), the announcement of Jair Bolsonaro as candidate for the republic's presidency (July, 2018), the first round of the presidential elections (October, 2018), and the announcement of changes to the Pension Reform (January, 2019). The results from the non parametric analysis indicate that, besides the events above, the exchange coupon was also affected by news related to the Labour Reform (March, 2017), to the impeachment requests of President Temer that followed the corruption scandal (August and October, 2017), and to the elections for the Chamber of Deputies' presidency (January and February, 2019).

\chapter{Introduction} \label{chapter_introduction}

    It is very common for the media around the world to announce the idea that a given political event has made an impact on the financial markets. In fact, newspapers constantly refer to political news as the cause of fluctuations in prices of financial assets. That explanation is inconsistent with the classical semi-strong market efficiency hypothesis as posed by \citet{fama1970} though, which states prices reflect all available public information.  
    
    The evidence on asset prices being affected by news about monetary variables (see \citet{cornell1983}), by news about the real sector (see, \citet{macqueenroley1993}, \citet{caporaleetal2015}) complicates the issue further. Still, in general, the semi-strong form market efficiency tests for political information in Brazil have shown supporting evidence for the hypothesis in the case of stock market returns and interest rates (\citet{marquessantos2016}).
    
    Indeed, the studies mentioned above test for efficiency in a national investor level, since they took for granted investor's return would be measured in domestic currency terms.  But, actually, foreign investors are responsible for 22.61\% of the volume daily traded in Brazilian stock market in 2019 as it can be seen in  \href{http://www.b3.com.br/data/files/14/B4/D5/25/4B80B61070D79EA6AC094EA8/partdir_NOVOv2.xls}{B3 Participation of Investors Report}.
    
    The problem we address here is whether political information affects the exchange coupon, which is the difference between the interest rate and exchange rate variation in a country, and measures the return for dollars invested locally. Therefore, the contribution made here is not only to investigate market efficiency in Brazil from a international, broader and more solid perspective but also establish a replicable methodology applicable to other countries' data.
    
    We follow \citet{marquessantos2016} methodology, that is: we apply web-scraping to search for news; we find the ones related to national political events by searching the headlines for keywords; we filter the exchange coupon for abnormal volatility; and finally we cross the data to determine whether abnormal volatility was related to political events. To find the periods with abnormal volatility for the exchange coupon, we apply \citet{bollerslev1986} GARCH as a filter, in which we search for abnormal values of the conditional standard deviation series with both a parametric and a non parametric analysis.

    It is worth noticing there are two measures of exchange coupon in Brazil. The first measure is the difference between the average rate of one-day inter-bank deposits (DI) and the exchange rate variation (as measured by PTAX800), while the other is the excess return of referential rate of the Special Settlement and Custody System (Selic) over exchange rate variation (PTAX800). 
  
    The paper is organized as follows: chapter \ref{chapter_institutional} describes the Brazilian institutional environment; chapter \ref{chapter_literature} reviews the literature on news and market efficiency; Chapter \ref{chapter_model} describes the model of market efficiency tested in this paper; Chapter \ref{chapter_methods_data} describes the data used and the methods applied; Chapter \ref{chapter_results_discussion} shows the results; and finally Chapter \ref{chapter_conclusion} shows the conclusions.

\chapter{The Institutional Environment} \label{chapter_institutional}

    Brazil's legal basis is defined in the 1988 Constitution (\citet{constituicao}). Brazil is a representative federative republic, where the government's power is divided in three branches, the Executive, Legislative and Judiciary, which are independent of each other. The country's president, chief of the Executive, is elected via universal direct secret compulsory vote by the citizens for a four-year term, and can be reelected only once. The senators and deputies, who make up the Legislative, are also elected this way, and have terms of eight and four years respectively. The constituents of the Judiciary, on the other hand, are almost all selected by pubic tender, as the ministers from the Supreme Court and Superior Justice Tribunal are indicated by the republic's president.

    The Brazilian Financial System (SFN) as it is today was instituted in Law 4.595, from December 1964 (\citet{lei4595}). The National Monetary Council (CMN) was established as the major normative institution of the Financial System, while the Central Bank of Brazil (BCB) was established as the major executive institution. CMN is composed by the Minister of Economy and the Central Bank's President, and defines the guidelines for the budget, fiscal, monetary, credit and exchange policies, while also establishing the rules for the SFN.

    The policies which guidelines are defined by the Monetary Council are executed by the Central Bank, which goal is to enforce the norms defined by the first. The Central Bank has the monopoly of currency issue, and executes the monetary policy and the exchange policy with the buying and selling of public debt securities, which are issued by the National Treasury (TN). The Central Bank's president is indicated by the republic's president, who can replace him anytime, therefore the institution is not independent - this issue was recently addressed by President Bolsonaro in a complementary bill project which alters Law 4.595 (\citet{lei4595}).

    Today's regimes for monetary and exchange policies started in 1999, with the establishment of the so-called Economic Tripod, which is a set of three regimes for economic policy: inflation targeting for the monetary policy, government surplus for the fiscal policy, and floating exchange rate for the exchange policy. The target for the inflation rate is defined by the Monetary Council, while the Monetary Policy Committee (CoPoM) defines the target for the short term interest rate (Selic) used for the monetary policy, and the Central Bank pursues this interest rate.

    The transferable securities market (securiries, commodities and derivatives exchanges) is disciplined and supervised by the Commission of Transferable Securities (CVM), established in Law 6.385, from December 1976 (\citet{lei6385}). Brazil has only one stock exchange, B3, which acts in all branches of the transferable securities market. B3 emerged as the fusion, in 2017, between BM\&FBOVESPA (itself the fusion of BM\&F (Commodities and Futures Exchange) and BOVESPA (São Paulo Securities Exchange)), and CETIP (Central of Custody and Financial Settlement of Private Securities).  In Table \ref{tab:sistemanacional} the structure of the National Financial System is represented for better visualization.

    \end{table}

    The structure described above has strong impact in the behaviour of the exchange coupon, as the coupon's interest rate component is closely related to the pursue of a inflation target, and it's exchange rate component fluctuates in a floating exchange rate regime.


\chapter{News and Market Efficiency} \label{chapter_literature}

    The Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH), as posed by \citet{fama1970}, states that security prices "fully reflect" available information, providing "accuarate signals for resource allocation". In the model, information is divided in three subsets. For the weak form efficiency, the information set is the historical prices of the security. For the semi strong form, it is all the publicly available information, and finally, for the strong form, it is all available information, even if held private. There is massive literature on market efficiency, as the hypothesis has enormous implications for trading strategies, since it indicates the impossibility of economic profit with existing information (\citet{kamal2014}). Our paper focus on semi strong form efficiency, as we work with information in the form of publicly available news.

    The evidence on the relationship between financial variables and news support that the first responds to the latter. News about the macroeconomy are shown to affect commodity prices in \citet{caporaleetal2015}, while \citet{macqueenroley1993} shows not only that the stock market responds to this subset of news, but that the response depends on the state of the economy. The use of news for trading strategies is shown to award economic profit in \citet{larsenthorsrud2017}. In \citet{moussaetal2017} it is shown that information supply has impact on prices, but the effect is more pronounced on volatility than on returns.

    \citet{caporaleetal2015} applies a VAR-GARCH model to analyze the spillovers between mean and variance of both macroeconomic news and commodity returns. The sample of returns is composed by ten commodities and the exchange rate, in a period of over 13 years. The news sample includes the worldwide coverage of four macroeconomic variables: GDP, unemployment, retail sales and durable good, which are are used in the making of two indexes, one for positive and one for negative news. The results show spillovers for all variables but gold and silver.
    In \citet{macqueenroley1993} it is analyzed if stock prices response to news vary over different stages of the business cycle. The sample of equity prices consists in the S\&P 500 Index from over 10 years, and the sample of series used to represent the stage of the economy consists of variables related to cash flows and equity discount rates. The results show that the stock market responds positively to good macroeconomic news when the economy is weak, but negatively when the economy is strong.

    Textual data is used to analyze the relationship between news topics and stock returns in \citet{larsenthorsrud2017}. The news sample comes from a daily Norwegian newspaper, and the stock prices sample comes from several firms listed in the Oslo Stock Exchange. The results show that news predict daily returns, allowing for investment strategies with economic returns.
    In \citet{moussaetal2017} news headlines are used to measure information supply, while search volume from Google Trends database is used to measure information demand. The sample of stocks is 25 stocks composing the Frech stock market index CAC40 and the index itself, and it's time range is seven years. A model is developed to test the relationship between the samples, and the results indicate that information affects asset prices, but while the effect on volatility is considerable, the effect on returns is small.

    When testing for political information, the results also support that security prices are responsive. Both \citet{smales2015} and \citet{marquessantos2016} show that political uncertainty is related to market uncertainty, the first for Australia and the latter for Brazil. The Brazilian stock market is also shown to react to tax announcements in \citet{gabrielribeiro2013}.

    \citet{smales2015} uses electoral polls data to construct two measures of political uncertainty. One represents overall election uncertainty, the other represents uncertainty about reelection, which is considered of importance as economic policies of a reelected president are well known in caparison with the policies of a newly elected president. The financial series are exchange-traded futures and options based on the Australian stock market index S\&P/ASX 200. Market volatility is shown to increase with political uncertainty, and decrease with the probability of reelection.
    In \citet{marquessantos2016} a GARCH model is applied to daily stock returns and short term interest rates in Brazil. The sample for the first is the Bovespa Index, and the sample for the latter is composed by the Selic rate and the DI rate. Samples range from January 2014 to April 2016. The results show that the the stock market only responds to political news in the case of elections, as the only period of abnormal volatility related to news happened to occur around the 2014 presidential elections' date. On the other hand, the short term interest rates do not respond to political news.
    \citet{gabrielribeiro2013} verifies if a government's annunciation of tax cuts affected stock prices of companies from the sector that would be directly affected. The referred tax is the Tax on Industrialized Products (IPI). After filtering for characteristics that would make the calculations possible, 13 stocks made to the final sample. The results indicate that the stock prices were indeed affected by the tax cut annunciation.

\chapter{The Model} \label{chapter_model}

    Market efficiency, as posed by \citet{fama1970}, is a implication of a perfect capital market (neither transaction or information costs), investor risk aversion, and two-parameter return distributions (\citet{famamcbeth1973}). If weak form market efficiency holds, then chartist or technical analysis is useless, and if the semi-strong form holds, then fundamental analysis, founded on public information, is useless (\citet{oprean2012}).

    For a brief demonstration of the model, we will consider that equilibrium prices are generated in the two parameter \citet{sharpe1964} world. Two assumptions about the investor are made: that he acts in the basis of two parameters of the distribution of returns of an asset - its expected value and standard deviation; and that he derives utility from returns and disutility from risk. The market is built upon two other assumptions: a common pure rate of interest; and homogeneity of investor expectations, as they agree on expected values, standard deviations, and correlations of the securities. In this world, the equilibrium expected return on a security is a function of it's correlation with a efficient combination of securities.
    
    Let $U$ denote the utility of an investor, $E_W$ denote the expected value of a security $W$, and $\sigma_W$ its standard deviation, the utility function of the investor is defined in Equation \ref{eqn:ut1}.
    
    \begin{equation}
        \label{eqn:ut1}
        U = f(E_W, \sigma_W)
    \end{equation}
    
    As the future value of a security is directly related to its return, let $R$ denote the return, the utility function can be defined as in Equation \ref{eqn:ut2}.

    \begin{equation}
        \label{eqn:ut2}
        U = g(E_R, \sigma_R)
    \end{equation}

    The investor likes return and dislikes risk, therefore the utility function is increasing with security's expected return and decreasing with its standard deviation, as shown in Equations \ref{eqn:der1} and \ref{eqn:der2}.
    
    \begin{equation}
        \label{eqn:der1}
        \frac{dU}{dE_R} > 0
    \end{equation}

    \begin{equation}
        \label{eqn:der2}
        \frac{dU}{d\sigma_R} < 0
    \end{equation}

    Let $i$ denote an investor among the population and $r$ denote the pure rate of interest, the assumption of a common pure rate of interest can be defined in Equation \ref{eqn:r}.

    \begin{equation}
        \label{eqn:r}
        r_i = r, \quad \forall i
    \end{equation}

    Let $a$ and $b$ denote each any security in the market, the assumption of homogeneous expectations can be defined in Equations \ref{eqn:equal_exp}, \ref{eqn:equal_std} and \ref{eqn:equal_cor}.

    \begin{equation}
        \label{eqn:equal_exp}
        E_{W_i} = E_W, \quad \forall i
    \end{equation}

    \begin{equation}
        \label{eqn:equal_std}
        \sigma_{W_i} = \sigma_W, \quad \forall i
    \end{equation}

    \begin{equation}
        \label{eqn:equal_cor}
        Cor(W_a, W_b)_i = Cor(W_a, W_b), \quad \forall i, a, b
    \end{equation}

    Let $G$ denote an efficient portfolio, the equilibrium expected return function derived from the assumptions above for any given security can be described in Equation \ref{eqn:exp_ret}.

    \begin{equation}
        \label{eqn:exp_ret}
        E_R = r + \frac{Cov(R_W, R_G)}{\sigma_{R_G}} (E_{R_G} - r)
    \end{equation}

    The model in Equation \ref{eqn:exp_ret} is called Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), and shows that the equilibrium expected return for a security is a function of its risk.
    
    Successive returns of prices which fully reflect available information are uncorrelated (\citet{samuelson1965}). Together with the assumption that successive price changes are identically distributed, this leads us to the random walk model (\citet{fama1970}). The random walk model is a special case of the AR(1) process. Let $w_t$ denote the security price at time $t$, the process is given by Equation \ref{eqn:rw1}.
    
    \begin{equation}
        \label{eqn:rw1}
        w_t = \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 w_{t-1} + \varepsilon
    \end{equation}

    where

    $$\alpha_0 = 0, \quad \alpha_1 = 1$$

    The returns from a random walk are white noise. Let $r_{t}$ denote the security return at time $t$, white noise is given by Equation \ref{eqn:rw2}.
    
    $$E(w_{t}) = w_{t-1}$$
    
    $$E(r_{t}) = E(w_{t}) - w_{t-1} = 0$$
    
    \begin{equation}
        \label{eqn:rw2}
        E(r_{t}) \sim f(0, \sigma)
    \end{equation}

    In order to find inefficiency, we look for unusual behaviour in the regression residuals. As with the random walk model, the residual at time $t$ (denoted by $e_t$) is given by Equation \ref{eqn:rw3}.

    $$e_t = r_t - E(r_t)$$

    \begin{equation}
        \label{eqn:rw3}
        e_t = r_t
    \end{equation}

    To find unusual behaviour in the residuals, we apply a GARCH (\citet{bollerslev1986}) model to the exchange coupon series, and filter the conditional standard deviation series extracted from the model for abnormal values.
    

\chapter{Methods and Data} \label{chapter_methods_data}

    In order to test the impact of political news on the exchange coupon, we searched for political news, calculated the exchange coupon (both the OC1 and the DI1 measures), tested the coupon for abnormal volatility, and finally we crossed the periods with abnormal volatility in the exchange coupon with the correspondent political news. The information on political news was gathered with web scrapping technique, applied in the main Brazilian news portal. A filter was applied to the news sample to find the ones related to national political events. We calculated the two different measures of exchange coupon negotiated in Brazil from its components (a shared exchange rate measure and two specific interest rate measures). To find the periods with abnormal volatility, we applied a GARCH model to the exchange coupon, and then filtered it's conditional standard deviation for abnormal values, with both a parametric and a non parametric approach.

\section{Data} \label{chapter_data}

    Based on data availability, our news sample begins at November 24, 2016, the first date for which there were political news available in the scrapped website. Our exchange rate and interest rates samples begin one day earlier, to allow for the exchange coupon series to begin with the news sample. All samples end at May 16, 2019.

\subsection{Political News} \label{chapter_political_news}
    
    We gathered information on political news by applying web scrapping technique to a online news portal. The scrapping was made in the political section of G1, a Brazilian news portal maintained by Grupo Globo, a conglomerate based in Rio de Janeiro. It provides content from Grupo Globo's television channels, radio stations, newspapers and magazines, besides it's own content. The scrapping was executed at May 17, 2019, and resulted in a sample of 17.836 news over 837 days. The dollar market closes at 6 pm, therefore all news after this time were pushed to the subsequent day. News from weekends and holidays were pushed to the closest subsequent business day.

    To find political events that could impact the exchange coupon, we follow \citet{bbb} as we searched our headlines sample for keywords. The keywords were: related to market uncertainty, 'incerteza', 'mercado' and 'economia' (uncertainty, market, economy); related to components of the exchange coupon, 'dólar', 'selic' and 'cdi' (dollar, Selic, DI) ; and related to federal government matters, 'presidente', 'presidência', 'câmara', 'senado', 'tribunal de contas da união', 'tcu', 'superior tribunal federal' and 'stf' (president, presidency, chamber (as in Chamber of Deputies), senate, Federal Accountability Office and its initials, and Supreme Court and its initials). The search resulted in a sample of 2.333 news. The final sample is 13\% the size of the unfiltered sample in terms of number of news, therefore, we excluded 87\% of the initial sample as it was composed of political news unrelated to federal political matters.

\subsection{Exchange Coupon} \label{chapter_exchange_coupon}

    In order to obtain the series for the exchange coupon (both the OC1 and the DI1 measures), we collected a sample of the dollar exchange rate PTAX 800 (PTAX), that was used for both measures, a sample of the referential rate of the Special Settlement and Custody System (Selic) for the OC1 measure, and a sample of the of the inter-bank deposit rate (DI) for the DI1 measure. All three series were collected from the Central Bank of Brazil Time Series Management System (BACEN-SGS), through it's Application Programming Interface (API). The exchange rate is measured in BRL/USD, and the interests rates are measured in \% a day.
    
    Our samples range from November 23, 2016 to May 16, 2019. They begin shortly after the end of the impeachment process of President Dilma Rousseff, at August 31, when President Temer (Ms Dilma's Vice President) took office after three months as Interim President. This happened during the largest economic crisis in Brazilian history, with the fourth trimester of 2016 being the last from a series of eleven in which the Gross Domestic Product decreased. The remaining period from our sample saw economic stagnation. Mr Temer's presidency was marked by reforms - like the Labour Reform, which successfully passed, and the Pension Reform, did not -, and by a corruption scandal involving him related to Operation Car Wash, a investigation on money laundry involving Brazilian politicians, which was very present in the media since even before his presidency. At October 2018 presidential elections were held, and Mr Bolsonaro was elected. The new president took office with his main focus as a new Pension Reform, which is still awaiting for approval by the time this is being written.
    

    Figure \ref{fig:ptax} shows the exchange rate (PTAX) series, Figure \ref{fig:selic} shows the referential rate of the Special Settlement and Custody System (Selic) series, and Figure \ref{fig:di} shows the inter-bank deposits rate (DI) series. The descriptive statistics for the series are shown in Table \ref{tab:desptaxselicdi}.

    The exchange coupon is the interest rate obtained from the difference between the accrued interest rate between the operation date and the business day preceding the due date, and the exchange rate variation observed between the business day preceding the operation date and the business day preceding the due date. We calculated both measures of the exchange coupon via Equation \ref{eqn:coupon}:

    \begin{equation}
        \label{eqn:coupon}
        ExchangeCoupon_t = \frac{1 + \frac{InterestRate_{t-1}}{100}}{\frac{ExchangeRate_t}{ExchangeRate_{t-1}}} - 1
    \end{equation}

    Figure \ref{fig:oc} shows the OC1 exchange coupon series, Figure \ref{fig:di} shows the DI1 exchange coupon series, and Table \ref{tab:desocdi} shows the descriptive statistics for both measures.

    \subfile{tables/desocdi.txt}

    Visually, both exchange coupon measures show a stationary form, nevertheless, we tested the series against the null hypothesis of presence of a unit root with the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test (\citet{adf}), and against the null hypothesis of stationarity around a deterministic trend with the Kwiatkowski– Phillips–Schmidt–Shin (KPSS) test (\citet{kpss}). The results for the ADF test are shown in Table \ref{tab:ocdiadf}, and the results for the KPSS test are shown in Table \ref{tab:ocdikpss}.

    \subfile{tables/ocdiadf.txt}

    \subfile{tables/ocdikpss.txt}

    The tests results in Tables \ref{tab:ocdiadf} and \ref{tab:ocdikpss} show support for the hypothesis of stationarity of the series that the visual analysis suggested to be true. For both measures of the exchange coupon the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test rejected the null hypothesis of presence of a unit root and the Kwiatkowski– Phillips–Schmidt–Shin test accepted the null hypothesis of stationarity around a deterministic trend.

\section{Methods} \label{chapter_methods}

\subsection{Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedastic Model}

    The Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedastic (GARCH) model, introduced in \citet{bollerslev1986}, is a generalization of the Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedastic (ARCH) model introduced in \citet{engle1982}, which models heteroscedasticity. While the most common models for time series assume a constant variance for the process (as ARIMA), the ARCH process assumes an inconstant variance conditional on past variance, together with a constant unconditional variance. The GARCH process assumes inconstant variance conditional on past conditional variance as well as past variance. Both ARCH and GARCH are serial uncorrelated processes with zero mean.

    Let $y_t$ denote a real-valued discrete time process and $\psi_t$ denote the information set at time $t$, the ARCH process is given by Equation \ref{eqn:archgarch} and Equation \ref{eqn:arch} while the GARCH process is given by Equation \ref{eqn:archgarch} and Equation \ref{eqn:garch}.

    \begin{equation}
        \label{eqn:archgarch}
        y_t | \psi_{t-1} \sim N(0,h_t)
    \end{equation}

    \begin{equation}
        \label{eqn:arch}
        h_t = \alpha_0 + \displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{q} \alpha_i y_{t-i}^2
    \end{equation}

    \begin{equation}
        \label{eqn:garch}
        h_t = \alpha_0 + \displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{q} \alpha_i y_{t-i}^2 + \displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{p} \beta_i h_{t-i}
    \end{equation}

    where

    $$q > 0, \quad   p \geq 0$$

    $$\alpha_0 > 0, \quad  \alpha_i \geq 0, \quad  i=1,...,q$$

    $$\beta_i \geq 0, \quad  i=1,...,p$$

    As we can see above, if $p = 0$ than it becomes a ARCH process. If also $q = 0$ than the process is white noise. We will use $h_t$, the conditional standard deviation, as a estimate for the exchange coupon's standard deviation at time $t$.

\subsection{Estimation} \label{chapter_estimation}

    We estimate a GARCH model for both measures of the exchange coupon. The model estimated will be a GARCH(1,1), therefore we must visually check if one lag for both the auto regressive and the moving average parts of the model is appropriate. We do so by visually inspecting the auto-correlation and partial auto-correlation functions. The graphs for the auto-correlation function and for the partial auto-correlation function are given in Figure \ref{fig:ocacf} and Figure \ref{fig:ocpacf}, respectively, for the OC1 exchange coupon, and in Figure \ref{fig:diacf} and Figure \ref{fig:dipacf} for the DI1 exchange coupon.

    \subfile{graphstext/ocacf.txt}

    \subfile{graphstext/ocpacf.txt}

    \subfile{graphstext/diacf.txt}

    \subfile{graphstext/dipacf.txt}

    The visual inspection shows support for the use of GARCH(1,1). After the fitting of the model, the residuals must behave like white noise, that is, the mean must be constant and equal to zero, and there must be no auto-correlation in the series. First, we inspect this behavior visually with the residuals graph and auto-correlation function. The graph for the residuals is shown in Figure \ref{fig:ocres} for the OC1 measure, and in Figure \ref{fig:dires} for the DI1 measure. The graph for the auto-correlation function is shown in Figure \ref{fig:ocresacf} for the OC1 measure and in Figure \ref{fig:diresacf} for the DI1 measure.

    \subfile{graphstext/ocres.txt}

    \subfile{graphstext/ocresacf.txt}

    \subfile{graphstext/dires.txt}

    \subfile{graphstext/diresacf.txt}

    The visual inspection shows white noise behaviour. To certify this behaviour, we test the null hypothesis that the residuals are independently distributed with the Ljung-Box test (\citet{boxpierce} and \citet{ljungbox}), and the null hypothesis that the residuals sample comes from a normal distributed population with the Shapiro-Wilk test (\citet{shapirowilk}). The results for the tests, for both measures of the exchange coupon, are shown in Table \ref{tab:reswhite}.

    \subfile{tables/reswhite.txt}

    The results shown in Table \ref{tab:reswhite} support the hypothesis that the residuals behave as white noise. The Ljung-Box tests cannot reject the null hypothesis that the residuals are independently distributed, while the Shapiro-Wilk tests accepted the null hypothesis that the residuals sample comes from a normal distributed population.

\subsection{Conditional Standard Deviation}

    From the GARCH model, we extract the conditional standard deviation (CSD) series, which values we use as an estimate for each period's standard deviation. The CSD series are shown in Figure \ref{fig:occsd} for the OC1 measure, and in Figure \ref{fig:dicsd} for the DI1 measure. The descriptive statistics for the series are shown in Table \ref{tab:descsd}

    \subfile{graphstext/occsd.txt}

    \subfile{graphstext/dicsd.txt}

    \subfile{tables/descsd.txt}

    We consider abnormal volatility every value outside the 95\% confidence interval, and we use both a parametric and a non parametric analysis to filter for abnormal volatility. In the former, we assume a two-parameter distribution for the population, in the latter we do not make this assumption.

\subsection{Parametric}

    In the parametric analysis, we assume a two parameter distribution for the conditional standard deviation series when computing the 95\% confidence interval that will be used to filter the series for abnormal volatility. The upper and lower limits are defined in Equations \ref{eqn:upp} and \ref{eqn:lop}: 

    $$\bar{X} = \frac{1}{n} \displaystyle\sum_{i=0}^{n} CSD_t$$

    $$\sigma^2 = \frac{1}{n-1} \displaystyle\sum_{i=0}^{n} (CSD_t - \bar{X})^2$$

    $$\sigma = \sqrt{\sigma^2}$$

    \begin{equation}
        \label{eqn:upp}
        UpperLimit_t = \bar{X} + 1.96 * \sigma
    \end{equation}

    \begin{equation}
        \label{eqn:lop}
        LowerLimit_t = \bar{X} - 1.96 * \sigma
    \end{equation}

    We test the the null hypothesis that the conditional standard deviation samples come from a normal distributed population with the Shapiro-Wilk test, which results are shown in Table \ref{tab:csdshapiro}.

    \subfile{tables/csdshapiro.txt}

    The test results shown in Table \ref{tab:csdshapiro} support the null hypothesis that the sample comes from a normally distributed population.

    The lower and upper limits are shown in Table \ref{tab:limpar} for both measures of the exchange coupon. Figure \ref{fig:oclimpar} and Figure \ref{fig:dilimpar} show the upper and lower limits altogether with the CDS series, for the OC1 and DI1 exchange coupons respectively.

    \subfile{tables/limpar.txt}

    \subfile{graphstext/oclimpar.txt}

    \subfile{graphstext/dilimpar.txt}

    Table \ref{tab:ocparout} and Table \ref{tab:diparout} show the details of each day with abnormal volatility, that is, the days in which the conditional standard deviation was outside the limits of the 95\% confidence interval, for the OC1 exchange coupon and for the DI1 exchange coupon respectively.

    \subfile{tables/ocparout.txt}

    \subfile{tables/diparout.txt}

    As we see in the tables above, the results are basically the same for both measures of the exchange coupon. There were 18 days of abnormal volatility, of which 4 are from 2016, 5 are from 2017, 8 are from 2018, and 1 is from 2019. Of these 18 days, in 10 the exchange coupons show positive values.


\subsection{Non Parametric}

    While in the parametric analysis we assumed a normal distribution for the population, in the non-parametric analysis we do not make this assumption. We calculated the mean and standard deviation for each day with a 63 days window (22 days before and 22 days after), which corresponds to three months of data. The definition of the 63 days windows was made based on the frequency of CoPoM meetings (one for every one and a half month), in which the goal for the Selic is defined, affecting directly both the Selic and the DI. The window is twice the period between meetings, therefore a quarter of year.

    We define the limits of the non-parametric analysis in Equations \ref{eqn:upnp} and \ref{eqn:lonp}.

    $$\bar{X}_t = \frac{1}{63} \displaystyle\sum_{i=t-22}^{t+22} CSD_t$$

    $$\sigma^2_t = \frac{1}{62} \displaystyle\sum_{i=t-22}^{t+22} (CSD_t - \bar{X}_t)^2$$

    $$\sigma_t = \sqrt{\sigma^2t}$$

    \begin{equation}
        \label{eqn:upnp}
        UpperLimit_t = \bar{X}_t + 1.96 * \sigma_t
    \end{equation}

    \begin{equation}
        \label{eqn:lonp}
        UpperLimit_t = \bar{X}_t - 1.96 * \sigma_t
    \end{equation}

    The lower and upper limits are shown in Table \ref{tab:limnon} for both measures of the exchange coupon. Figure \ref{fig:oclimnon} and Figure \ref{fig:dilimnon} show the upper and lower limits altogether with the CDS series, for the OC1 and DI1 exchange coupons respectively.

    \subfile{tables/limnon.txt}

    \subfile{graphstext/oclimnon.txt}

    \subfile{graphstext/dilimnon.txt}

    Table \ref{tab:ocnonout} and Table \ref{tab:dinonout} show the details of each day with abnormal volatility, that is, the days in which the conditional standard deviation was outside the limits of the 95\% confidence interval, for the OC1 exchange coupon and for the DI1 exchange coupon respectively.

    \subfile{tables/ocnonout.txt}

    \subfile{tables/dinonout.txt}

    As we see in the tables above, the results are basically the same for both measures of the exchange coupon. There were 29 days of abnormal volatility, of which 3 are from 2016, 8 are from 2017, 10 are from 2018, and 8 are from 2019. Of these 29 days, in 16 the exchange coupons show positive values.

\chapter{Results and Discussion} \label{chapter_results_discussion}

    After having filtered the exchange coupon for abnormal volatility, and the news for national political events, we match the two samples to find what political events happened to occur in the days of abnormal volatility. With this information we can analyze the impact of political news in the exchange coupon.

    The days of abnormal volatility for both measures of the exchange coupon were the same in each approach (parametric and non parametric), therefore we will talk about the results without referencing a specific measure.

\section{Parametric}

    The political news for each day of abnormal volatility for the parametric analysis are shown in Table \ref{tab:parnews}. There are a total of 69 news in 14 days of abnormal volatility.

    \subfile{tables/parnews.txt}

    The 14 days of abnormal volatility are divided in 5 periods. The first period started at April 19, 2017 with the corruption scandal of President Michel Temer, and lasted until April 25 - therefore, a whole week. The scandal begun with the disclosure by the Supreme Court of a recording of a conversation between Mr Temer and the businessman Joesley Batista - owner of JBS, which was, and still is by the time this is written, the largest meat processing company in the world -, who delivered the recording to the authorities as part of a plea bargain. The date in which the recording was revealed was commonly dubbed as 'Joesley Day', as it was a day of of high volatility both in the stock and in the dollar markets. In fact, the conditional standard deviation for both measures of exchange coupon was of 0.033 (for scale, the maximum and minimum value of the 95\% confidence interval are of 0.011 and 0.005 respectively).

    The second period was between June 11 and 13, 2019, when news dealt with the visit of Paraguay's newly elected president Marido Abdo Benítez to President Temer, with a encounter of Petrobra's President with the Legislative and Judiciary, and with the change of judges from Superior Justice Tribunal in a process from Operation Car Wash, among other topics. The third period lasted only a single day, the 23th of July, 2018. In this date both Jair Bolsonaro, from Liberal Social Party (PSL), and Guilherme Boulos, from Socialism and Liberty Party (PSOL), were confirmed as candidates for the presidential elections that would be held in October.

    The fourth and second last period of abnormal volatility begun 6 days before, and ended 2 days after, the first round of the 2018 presidential elections. At October 4th, when the period of abnormal volatility started, a voter intent survey was released which result was, in the case of a second round between Jair Bolsonaro (PSL) and Fernanando Haddad (Worker's Party (PT)), of 43\% of votes for the first and 42\% for the latter, therefore a technical draw.

    The last period was the January 4th. At the time, Bolsonaro was talking about trying to pass a new Pension Reform rather than working on the approval of the one from the previous president, Mr Temer.

    After knowing the political news that match with the abnormal volatility days, we are able to hypothesize on which political news actually had an effect in the exchange coupon. We considered that mainly matters related to changes in the presidency affected the financial variable, followed by matters about the Pension Reform. Both the arise of the possibility of a impeachment of President Temer caused by a corruption scandal, and the presidential elections with two opposing leading candidates, brought abnormal volatility. The annoucement of a new Pension Reform also had this effect. These periods are shown in Table \ref{tab:respar}.

    \begin{table}[H]

            \hline
        \end{tabular}
    \end{table}

\section{Non Parametric}

    The political news for each day of abnormal volatility, for the non parametric analysis, are shown in Table \ref{tab:nonnews}. There are a total of 151 news in 26 days of abnormal volatility.

    \subfile{tables/nonnews.txt}

    The 26 days of abnormal volatility are divided in 15 periods. At March 17, 2017, there was news about the voting of the Labour Reform. The three days of abnormal volatility between April 19 and 23, 2017, saw the beginning of the corruption scandal of President Temer, as mentioned in the previous section. Abnormal volatility returned at August 17, when the Brazilian Bar Association (OAB) triggered the Supreme Court to make the Chamber of Representatives' President analyze the impeachment requests he had received (there were 25 at the time). The impeachment matter correlated with abnormal volatility for the last time at October 25, when the Chamber of Representatives voted for the corruption denunciation against President Temer not to be sent to the Supreme Court, where it would be judged. At December 1st, is was disclosed that the president of the Party of the Republic (PR) used a apartment of the Chamber of Deputies while fugitive (he was convicted for corruption).

    Abnormal volatility for the year of 2018 started in a period ranging from January 26 to January 29, where news about corruption being more decisive than economics in the presidential elections were published. Between June 11 and June 13, there were 11 news, from which the main ones were listed in the previous sub chapter. At July 23, both Jair Bolsonaro, from Liberal Social Party (PSL), and Guilherme Boulos, from Socialism and Liberty Party (PSOL), were confirmed as candidates for the presidential elections that would occur in October. As in the parametric analysis, the days surrounding the first round of the presidential elections (October 4 to 10) were of abnormal volatility.

    The fourth day of 2019 presidency was the first day of Bolsonaro's presidency to show abnormal volatility. At the time, Bolsonaro was talking about trying to pass a new Pension Reform rather than working on the approval of the reform from the previous president, Mr Temer. From January 7 to January 8, both Brazilian Party of Social Democracy (PSDB), Party of the Republic (PR) and party Podemos (called National Labour Party until 2016) announced support for the reelection of Rodrigo Maia for the Chamber of Deputies' presidency. The reelection occurred at February 1st, the date with the most political news - 31 - and correlated with abnormal volatility. At March 25 Chamber of Representative's president, Rodrigo Maia, said president Bolsonaro would lead the political articulation for the Pension Reform, and three days later the rapporteur for the Reform was chosen. The last period of abnormal volatility for our sample ranged from April 1st to 2nd, when the Plateau Palace, house of president Bolsonaro, share a video negating the denomination 'coup' for the military movement of 1964 which overthrew the government.

    The results from the non parametric analysis add to the results of the parametric analysis, as they show that not only matters related to changes in the presidency and the Pension Reform affected the exchange coupon, but matters related to the presidency of the Chamber of Deputies and the Labour reform also did - the remaining news topics from our sample were considered of minor significance. The announcement of the voting of the Labour Reform had effect at March 2017. Even in the matters related to the presidency, more political events affected the exchange coupon: the possibility of impeachment of president Michel Temer impacted the exchange coupon not only in May 2017 (as in the parametric analysis), but in August and October as well. In August, OAB triggered the Supreme Court to make the Chamber of Representatives' President analyze the impeachment requests he had received, while in October the denunciation against the president was rejected by the Chamber of Deputies. The 2018 presidential elections had effect on the exchange coupon just like in the parametric analysis, with the announcement of Jair Bolsonaro as candidate (July 2018) and the first round of the elections (October 2018). The announcement of a new Pension Reform at January 2019 also had the same effect as in the parametric analysis. The elections for the presidency of the Chamber of Deputies, that took place in February 2019, also brought abnormal volatility, with both the announcement of support for the reelection of Mr Maia by PSDB, and the reelection itself. These periods are shown in Table \ref{tab:resnon}.

\chapter{Conclusion} \label{chapter_conclusion}

    In order to test the market for semi-strong form efficiency, we analyzed the impact of political news on the country's exchange coupon. We cross referenced the days with abnormal returns for the exchange coupon with the days with political news. Ir order to achieve that, we filtered the news collected via web scrapping for national political events, and applied a GARCH filter in the exchange coupon to find abnormal returns. We performed both a parametric and a non parametric analysis.

    The results, from both the parametric and non parametric analysis, show support for the semi-strong form efficient market hypothesis. From 2333 with political news, only a small fraction had effect over the exchange coupon - 58 news in the parametric analysis (2.5\% of the total), and 105 news in the non parametric analysis (4.5\%). Nevertheless, if compared to other types of news that could impact the exchange coupon - such as macroeconomic and international - political news had considerable impact. In the parametric analysis, political news were accountable for 11 out of 18 days of abnormal volatility (61\%), and in the non parametric analysis they were accountable for 13 out of 29 days (45\%).

    The parametric and non parametric analysis differ in their results, but both indicate that the exchange coupon was affected by political news about changes in the federal presidency and about the Pension Reform. Changes in the presidency means both the 2018 elections, with its first round and the announcement of later-to-become president Jair Bolsonaro as candidate, and the corruption scandal with President Michel Temer at May 2017, which was followed by various impeachment requests. The Pension Reform had its effect with the announcement by President Bolsonaro of a new one, rather than working for the approval of the Reform proposed by Mr Temer.

    While the parametric analysis indicates that the relationship between political news and the exchange coupon is limited to the one mentioned above, the non parametric analysis indicates that this relationship goes further, as political news of less (but in no way small) significance also affected the exchange coupon. In the case of the corruption scandal with President Temer, abnormal volatility was brought also by the triggering of the Supreme Court, by the Brazilian Bar Association (OAB), to make the Chamber of Representatives' President analyze the impeachment requests he had received, and by the voting by the Chamber of Deputies for the corruption denunciation not to be sent to the Supreme Court. In the non parametric analysis, not only the Pension Reform affected the exchange coupon but also the Labour Reform, when the Chamber of Deputies' president announced its voting. Other than the elections for the federal presidency, the elections for the Chamber of Deputies' presidency also were shown to affect the coupon, and as in the federal, both announcement of support for Rodrigo Maria's candidacy and the election itself caused abnormal volatility.

    These results follow \citet{smales2015} and \citet{marquessantos2016}, as they both show that political uncertainty, as with who will win the elections, causes market uncertainty. Nevertheless, in our analysis more events related to the republic's presidency had effect over the market, just as matters related to the Chamber of Deputies and to reforms also did. This difference in results may arrive from differences between the foreign and national investors, with the first being more sensitive to political information.

    As extension to the current research, the analysis could be made on an more extensive period, on an more extensive news sample (as from other sources), and on other securities from the Brazilian market.
